# node-course-2-chat-app
This is a node course project from 'The Complete Node.js Developer Course (2nd Edition)' in udemy.<br> 
Two applications are merged in this repository:<br>

<ol>
  <li>Design a TODO Application using REST API, mongoDB and authentication with JWT.</li>
  <li>Chat room using socket.io</li>
</ol>

Auto testing tools:
<ol>
  <li>Mocha</li>
  <li>expect</li>
  <li>Supertest</li>
</ol>

I really learn a lot from this course and will add more features based on these examples.<br>
